# O Manifesto Lambda I/O

> Não, esse projeto não tem relação com o uso de programação funcional com
tratamento monádico para efeitos colaterais. Na verdade, é uma iniciativa aberta
para **espalhar conhecimento de programação funcional pelo mundo**.

## Quem somos?

A Fundação Lambda I/O consiste de uma iniciativa aberta que visa a
introduzir as pessoas ao redor do mundo a todos os recursos e benefícios de se
conhecer o paradigma de programação funcional.

Pretendemos fazer isso através da organização de pequenos meetups - com um
ambiente acolhedor - sobre programação funcional pelo mundo que culminariam em
uma grande conferência por país.

Nossa missão é desconstruir a doutrinação a cerca do ensino de linguagens
imperativas que, infelizmente, assola muitos lugares do mundo e,
consecutivamente, seus sistemas de ensino de TI - desde cursos técnicos a
pós-graduações -, fornecendo recursos e uma comunidade que tornaria muito mais
fácil de se aprender sobre programação funcional, linguagens funcionais, casos
de uso etc.

## Motivation

This initiative was born in Brazil, created by a small group of technical and
undergraduate students who were simply tired of learning always the same
imperative-related concepts and languages in their classes.

As the [functional buzz](https://medium.com/@jugoncalves/functional-programming-should-be-your-1-priority-for-2015-47dd4641d6b9)
grows it is very common to see nowadays people who have been wondering what
functional programming is all about but can't find the right resources, good
motivation or even a community to support his/her studies and then give up on
learning. The situation becomes even worse when we realize that many of IT
professionals, people who deal with software development - and even Computer
Science students - have never heard of a different paradigm such as the
functional one.

## How?

### Meetups

The idea is to make small Lambda I/O Meetups per city. Those meetups consists of
an one-day meetup with talks - and maybe workshops - about everything in the
functional world:

- The paradigm itself
- *Purist* languages
- Functional libs and implementations
- Parallelism/Concurrency
- Benefits
- Use cases
- ...

Those *Lambda I/O Meetups* have a pre-formatted style which can be found [here](https://github.com/lambda-io/meetup-organization-guidelines).

### Conferences

The small meetups aim to promote the functional knowledge in distributed/
*(de)centralized* way but they aren't enough since they exactly **small meetups**.
So it is also important to promote big conferences yearly which would congregate
big amounts of people per country.

Those *Lambda I/O Conferences* have a pre-formatted style which can be found [here](https://github.com/lambda-io/conference-organization-guidelines).

## Our principles

### People matter

As stated in the [Motivation](#motivation) section, people are our reason. So it is very important to think about their experience - by helping them and being as nice as possible. Functional paradigm can be awesome - so why can't try to make people learning it feel awesome too?

### (De)centralization

Our philosophy works based on a centralized model of decentralization.
To help understanding, it can be divided in two points:

#### Decentralization

- **Anyone** has the freedom to organize Lambda I/O events **wherever** and
**whenever** he/she wants.

- The meetups are **independent of each other**.

- The Lambda I/O Foundation does not set specific details of the individual
scope of each meetup - such as *dates, agenda, sponsors, supporters* etc.

#### Centralization

- To make the organization and interaction of meetups with the proposal of the
foundation easier, all organizational repositories of meetups and conferences
are gathered in the [Lambda I/O Foundation](https://github.com/lambda-io)'s
Github organization. For each meetup it is created a team that will have full
power to define the details described in the [Decentralization](#decentralization) principle and
the teams only have access to their meetups - ensuring their independence. The
born of a meetup - and their respective team in the [Lambda I/O Foundation](https://github.com/lambda-io)'s
Github organization - only needs the interest of a possible facilitator as
stated [here](https://github.com/lambda-io/meetup-organization-guidelines).

- All the events - meetups and conferences - **must adhere to the basic
principles of the foundation** - as its proposal, code of conduct etc.

## Useful Links

> We aim to have many useful repositories to help people with all the *Lambda I/O* purpose, they are:

- [Meetup Organizer Manual](https://github.com/lambda-io/meetup-organization-guidelines)

  A simple guide on how to organize Lambda I/O meetups.

- [Conference Organizer Manual](https://github.com/lambda-io/conference-organization-guidelines)

  A simple guide on how to organize Lambda I/O conferences.

- [Resources](https://github.com/lambda-io/resources)

  Repo containing some resources which aim to help organizers of Lambda I/O events across the world.

- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/lambda-io/code-of-conduct)

  Every event needs one.

- [Meetup Logo Generator](https://github.com/lambda-io/meetup-logo-generator)

  Logo Generator for every city meetup.

- [Meetup/Conference Site Boilerplate](https://github.com/lambda-io/site-boilerplate)

  Such a very easy way to create websites for conferences/meetups.
