## Who are we?

The Lambda I/O Foundation consists of an open initiative which is aims to
introduce people around the world to all the features and benefits of the
functional paradigm knowledge.

We intend to do that by organizing small, friendly-environmented, meetups on
functional programming around the world which would climax in a big event per
country.

Our mission is to deconstruct the indoctrination surrounding imperative
languages teaching  which unfortunately plagues many places in the world and,
respectively, their IT education systems - ranging from technical to
postgraduates courses by providing resources and a community that makes it
easier to learn about functional programming, functional languages, use cases etc.
