# The Lambda I/O Manifest

> No, it's not about the use of functional programming with monadic treatment
for side effects. It is actually an open initiative to **spread functional
knowledge through the world**.

## Who are we?

The Lambda I/O Foundation consists of an open initiative which is aims to
introduce people around the world to all the features and benefits of the
functional paradigm knowledge.

We intend to do that by organizing small, friendly-environmented, meetups on
functional programming around the world which would climax in a big event per
country.

Our mission is to deconstruct the indoctrination surrounding imperative
languages teaching  which unfortunately plagues many places in the world and,
consecutively, their IT education systems - ranging from technical to
postgraduates courses by providing resources and a community that makes it
easier to learn about functional programming, functional languages, use cases etc.

## Motivation

This initiative was born in Brazil, created by a small group of technical and
undergraduate students who were simply tired of learning always the same
imperative-related concepts and languages in their classes.

As the [functional buzz](https://medium.com/@jugoncalves/functional-programming-should-be-your-1-priority-for-2015-47dd4641d6b9)
grows it is very common to see nowadays people who have been wondering what
functional programming is all about but can't find the right resources, good
motivation or even a community to support his/her studies and then give up on
learning. The situation becomes even worse when we realize that many of IT
professionals, people who deal with software development - and even Computer
Science students - have never heard of a different paradigm such as the
functional one.

## How?

### Meetups

The idea is to make small Lambda I/O Meetups per city. Those meetups consists of
an one-day meetup with talks - and maybe workshops - about everything in the
functional world:

- The paradigm itself
- *Purist* languages
- Functional libs and implementations
- Parallelism/Concurrency
- Benefits
- Use cases
- ...

Those *Lambda I/O Meetups* have a pre-formatted style which can be found [here](https://github.com/lambda-io/meetup-organization-guidelines).

### Conferences

The small meetups aim to promote the functional knowledge in distributed/
*(de)centralized* way but they aren't enough since they exactly **small meetups**.
So it is also important to promote big conferences yearly which would congregate
big amounts of people per country.

Those *Lambda I/O Conferences* have a pre-formatted style which can be found [here](https://github.com/lambda-io/conference-organization-guidelines).

## Our principles

### People matter

As stated in the [Motivation](#motivation) section, people are our reason. So it is very important to think about their experience - by helping them and being as nice as possible. Functional paradigm can be awesome - so why can't try to make people learning it feel awesome too?

### (De)centralization

Our philosophy works based on a centralized model of decentralization.
To help understanding, it can be divided in two points:

#### Decentralization

- **Anyone** has the freedom to organize Lambda I/O events **wherever** and
**whenever** he/she wants.

- The meetups are **independent of each other**.

- The Lambda I/O Foundation does not set specific details of the individual
scope of each meetup - such as *dates, agenda, sponsors, supporters* etc.

#### Centralization

- To make the organization and interaction of meetups with the proposal of the
foundation easier, all organizational repositories of meetups and conferences
are gathered in the [Lambda I/O Foundation](https://github.com/lambda-io)'s
Github organization. For each meetup it is created a team that will have full
power to define the details described in the [Decentralization](#decentralization) principle and
the teams only have access to their meetups - ensuring their independence. The
born of a meetup - and their respective team in the [Lambda I/O Foundation](https://github.com/lambda-io)'s
Github organization - only needs the interest of a possible facilitator as
stated [here](https://github.com/lambda-io/meetup-organization-guidelines).

- All the events - meetups and conferences - **must adhere to the basic
principles of the foundation** - as its proposal, code of conduct etc.
