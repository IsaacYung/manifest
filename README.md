# The Lambda I/O Manifest

## Table of contents

## Who are we?

The Lambda I/O Foundation consists of an open initiative which is aims to
introduce people around the world to all the features and benefits of the
functional paradigm knowledge.

We intend to do that by organizing small, friendly-environmented, meetups on
functional programming around the world which would climax in a big event per
country.

Our mission is to deconstruct the indoctrination surrounding imperative
languages teaching  which unfortunately plagues many places in the world and,
respectively, their IT education systems - ranging from technical to
postgraduates courses by providing resources and a community that makes it
easier to learn about functional programming, functional languages, use cases etc.

## Motivation

This initiative was born in Brazil, created by a small group of technical and
undergraduate students who were simply tired of learning always the same
imperative-related concepts and languages in their classes.

As the [functional buzz](https://medium.com/@jugoncalves/functional-programming-should-be-your-1-priority-for-2015-47dd4641d6b9)
grows it is very common to see nowadays people who have been wondering what
functional programming is all about but can't find the right resources, good
motivation or even a community to support his/her studies and then give up on
learning. The situation becomes even worse when we realize that many of IT
professionals, people who deal with software development - and even Computer
Science students - have never heard of a different paradigm such as the
functional one.

## How

### Meetups

The idea is to make small Lambda I/O Meetups per city. Those meetups consists of
an one-day meetup with talks - and maybe workshops - about everything in the
functional world:

- The paradigm itself
- *Purist* languages
- Functional libs and implementations
- Parallelism/Concurrency
- Benefits
- Use cases
- ...

Those *Lambda I/O Meetups* have a pre-formatted style which can be found [here](https://github.com/lambda-io/meetup-organization-guidelines).

### Conferences

The small meetups aim to promote the functional knowledge in distributed/
decentralized way but they aren't enough since they exactly **small meetups**.
So it is also important to promote big conferences yearly which would congregate
big amounts of people per country.
