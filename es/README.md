# El manifiesto Lambda I/O

> No, eso no és sobre la utilización de programación funcional con tratamientos
con monads para efectos secundarios. Eso és, actualmente, una iniciativa
abierta para **propagar programación funcional por todo el mundo**.

## ¿Quiénes somos?

La Fundación Lambda/IO és una iniciativa abierta que pretende introducir a la
gente de todo el mundo las ventajas y características del paradigma funcional.

Nuestro objectivo es lograr eso con la organización de pequeños, aunque
amigables meetups centrándose en programación funcional en todo el mundo, que
culminaría en un gran evento por cada país.

Nuestra misión es deconstruir el adoctrinamiento que rodea lenguajes impertivos,
enseñando lo que, desafortunadamente, asola muchos lugares en el mundo y,
consecutivamente, los sistemas de TI - que van desde cursos técnicos hasta
cursos de postgrado, proporcionando recursos y una comunidad que hace con que
sea fácil aprender acerca de lenguajes funcionales, el paradigma funcional y
casos de uso.

## Motivation

This initiative was born in Brazil, created by a small group of technical and
undergraduate students who were simply tired of learning always the same
imperative-related concepts and languages in their classes.

As the [functional buzz](https://medium.com/@jugoncalves/functional-programming-should-be-your-1-priority-for-2015-47dd4641d6b9)
grows it is very common to see nowadays people who have been wondering what
functional programming is all about but can't find the right resources, good
motivation or even a community to support his/her studies and then give up on
learning. The situation becomes even worse when we realize that many of IT
professionals, people who deal with software development - and even Computer
Science students - have never heard of a different paradigm such as the
functional one.

## How?

### Meetups

The idea is to make small Lambda I/O Meetups per city. Those meetups consists of
an one-day meetup with talks - and maybe workshops - about everything in the
functional world:

- The paradigm itself
- *Purist* languages
- Functional libs and implementations
- Parallelism/Concurrency
- Benefits
- Use cases
- ...

Those *Lambda I/O Meetups* have a pre-formatted style which can be found [here](https://github.com/lambda-io/meetup-organization-guidelines).

### Conferences

The small meetups aim to promote the functional knowledge in distributed/
*(de)centralized* way but they aren't enough since they exactly **small meetups**.
So it is also important to promote big conferences yearly which would congregate
big amounts of people per country.

Those *Lambda I/O Conferences* have a pre-formatted style which can be found [here](https://github.com/lambda-io/conference-organization-guidelines).

## Our principles

### People matter

As stated in the [Motivation](#motivation) section, people are our reason. So it is very important to think about their experience - by helping them and being as nice as possible. Functional paradigm can be awesome - so why can't try to make people learning it feel awesome too?

### (De)centralization

Our philosophy works based on a centralized model of decentralization.
To help understanding, it can be divided in two points:

#### Decentralization

- **Anyone** has the freedom to organize Lambda I/O events **wherever** and
**whenever** he/she wants.

- The meetups are **independent of each other**.

- The Lambda I/O Foundation does not set specific details of the individual
scope of each meetup - such as *dates, agenda, sponsors, supporters* etc.

#### Centralization

- To make the organization and interaction of meetups with the proposal of the
foundation easier, all organizational repositories of meetups and conferences
are gathered in the [Lambda I/O Foundation](https://github.com/lambda-io)'s
Github organization. For each meetup it is created a team that will have full
power to define the details described in the [Decentralization](#decentralization) principle and
the teams only have access to their meetups - ensuring their independence. The
born of a meetup - and their respective team in the [Lambda I/O Foundation](https://github.com/lambda-io)'s
Github organization - only needs the interest of a possible facilitator as
stated [here](https://github.com/lambda-io/meetup-organization-guidelines).

- All the events - meetups and conferences - **must adhere to the basic
principles of the foundation** - as its proposal, code of conduct etc.

  A simple guide on how to organize Lambda I/O conferences.

- [Resources](https://github.com/lambda-io/resources)

  Repo containing some resources which aim to help organizers of Lambda I/O events across the world.

- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/lambda-io/code-of-conduct)
