# Contributing Guidelines

**Contributions are welcome!**

> Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!

Please search issues and pull requests before adding something new to avoid duplicating efforts and conversations.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

## The 5 magic steps

1. Fork it!
1. Create your feature branch: git checkout -b my-new-feature
1. Commit your changes: git commit -m 'Add some feature'
1. Push to the branch: git push origin my-new-feature
1. Submit a pull request :)

## Rules

There are a few basic ground rules for collaborators:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
